# Case Study: EOSIO

## Overview

EOSIO is an open source blockchain protocol designed to facilitate efficient and scalable decentralized applications (dapp). It was founded in 2017 by Daniel Larimer and Brenden Blumer under the Block.One company. Dan Larimer is known for developing the delegated proof-of-stake (DPoS) consensus mechanism, and the DPoS mechanism is used to operate the EOSIO blockchain.

## EOSIO Business and Landscape 

EOSIO’s customer scope is broad ranging from individual developers, entrepreneurs to publicly traded companies. Several popular blockchain platforms such as bitcoin and ethereum are burdened by large fees and limited computational capacity that prevent widespread blockchain adoption. The EOSIO platform seeks to provide scalable dapps that are easy to deploy and maintain while simultaneously executing millions of transactions every second and eliminating user fees. EOSIO uses the EOS cryptocurrency to support the network. 
The EOSIO blockchain was built with the goals of supporting millions of users on a platform that is free to use while offering low latency, and sequential and parallel computational performance. The blockchain also sought to offer easy upgrades and bug fixes to software built on the EOSIO platform. 

## Risks and Outlook

The delegated staking mechanism that makes EOSIO so quick with transactions also gives it some vulnerabilities. The voting mechanism makes it vulnerable to 51% attacks and major players colluding together to keep themselves in the democratically elected voting group. The departure of CTO and founder Dan Larimer also throws uncertainty to the longevity of the project.

Competitors include Ethereum, Lisk, Telos, Cardano, and Worbli. Telos, and Worbli are EOSIO code fork chains, and have seen several developers move from the EOSIO network. Although initially touted as the Ethereum killer, and it’s mainnet token EOS once reaching the 4th highest market cap, it has since fallen to the 25th in terms of market cap. Ethereum is still the most popular choice for dapp development, and the launch of Ethereum 2.0 will only further jeopardize the future of EOSIO. 

The EOSIO team maintains its commitment to making improvements with Google cloud joining the blockchain producer community with hopes of becoming a voting member of the blockchain.
